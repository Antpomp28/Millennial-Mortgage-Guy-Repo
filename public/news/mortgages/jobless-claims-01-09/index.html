            </div>

            <p>Jobless Claims continue to move in the wrong direction, as another 965,000 people filed for unemployment benefits for the first time during the week ending January 9. This was well above estimates and, unfortunately, around five times the number of Initial Jobless Claims that were being filed each week before the pandemic began.</p>
<p>Inflation also made headlines, as it remained tame overall at both the wholesale and consumer levels in December per the latest Producer and Consumer Price Index reports. At the consumer level, Core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was up only 0.1% from November to December while the year over year reading remained stable at 1.6%. Read on to learn why inflation data is critical to monitor when it comes to home loan rates.</p>
<p>The pandemic continues to impact manufacturers and retailers around the country. The Empire State Index (which shows the health of the manufacturing sector in the New York region) came in below expectations in January while December Retail Sales fell by 0.7% versus expectations of a 0.1% loss. Retail Sales in November were also revised lower by 0.3% to a loss of 1.4%.</p>
<p>Following suit, the National Federation of Independent Business Small Business Optimism Index dropped 5.5 points in December to 95.9, which is a 7-month low. Most of the categories were lower, with those who expect a better economy falling 24 points to -16.</p>
<p>NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said, “Small businesses are concerned about potential new economic policy in the new administration and the increased spread of COVID-19 that is causing renewed government-mandated business closures across the nation.”</p>
<p>Plans for more stimulus are on the horizon, however. President-elect Biden released details for the American Rescue Plan, which are highlighted below.</p>
